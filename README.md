# EvilHangMan

EvilHangMan is an old project from last year that I worked on with a partner for AP Computer Science.

This version of hangman involves the player competing against the computer. However, the computer cheats on the player as he/she makes more guesses. As the player makes more guesses on letters and narrows down words, the computer scans through a library of words that have the size displayed to the user and keeps on changing the word it is planning to use to try to prevent the user from winning. This project was written in Java.
